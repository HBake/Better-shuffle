# Better-shuffle
As an avid electronic music fan and Spotify user, I was shocked to learn that Spotify's 'Shuffle' feature prioritizes songs that cost them less per play instead of being truly random. To fix this, I made a python script that creates a list of song ID's that are in my library, randomize the order, and then insert back into a playlist in a truly (pseudo) random order. To activate this script, all I have to do is play the song 'Sandstorm - Darude' on my Spotify account. It will recognize the song ID current playing, randomize all of my tracks, and then quickly switch my currently-playing song to the first one in the playlist.
